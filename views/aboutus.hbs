      <br>
      <p>We have created this website in order to help the current society with the issue of neighborhood and small home
        business not getting the attention that they deserve! Filtering within social media to find these businesses
        would be a hassle so now sellers would showcase their products. Today, with COVID, more and more people are only
        able to buy and host the selling from home rather than specific or crowded places.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What our website features:
      <p>
        <br>
      <p>→ a vast variety of resources allocated for you to intertwine with a community with similar interests in
        selling homemade products.</p>
      <br>
      <p>→ customers within this website can cheer on and buy for business going on near them or within a radius.</p>
      <br>
      <p>→ more exposure of your business or people with limited areas when it does drown in common media.</p>
